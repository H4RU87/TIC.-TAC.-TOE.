## **Tools Used:**

HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript,
Trello, Wireframe, SublimeText3

## **Bottle Necks:**

- Board cells kept going out of line after move was placed. 
- Reinitialize the board without turning off the mouse click event handler. 
- Using CSS to position my game layout.


## **Above and Beyond:**


* Create a player vs computer mode. 
* Create advanced AI level mode. 

## **Future Upgrade Plan:**

Make the game compatible with other browsers using viewport.

## **Lesson Learned:**  
 
Better understanding of how to use CSS. When positioning your elements start with the big ones and narrow it down.
