## **Tools Used:**

Trello, Wireframe, SublimeText3, Google

## **Bottle Necks:**

- Board cells kept going out of line after move was placed. 
- Reinitialize the board without turning off the mouse click event handler. 
- Using CSS to position my game layout.


## **Above and Beyond:**


* Create a player vs computer mode. 
* Create advanced AI level mode. 

## **Future Upgrade Plan:**

Make the game compatible with other browsers.

## **Lesson Learned:**  
 
 
- When positioning your elements start with the big ones and narrow it down. 
- Utilize chrome developer tools to observe behavior.
- Create better testing environment and procedures.
- Time management / Project management : Set priorities and make development decisions as the project flows.
